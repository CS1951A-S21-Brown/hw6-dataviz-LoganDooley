    <p>Question 1: Graph 1 answers the question by taking the top 10 video games
    and clearly ranking them in the bar chart along with their respective numbers
    of sales for comparison. Graph 2 answers the question by having an interactive 
    pi chart which displays the percentage of overall sales per genre depending on
    the region you select. The largest pie slice represents the most
    popular genre of the region. Graph 3 answers the prompt by displaying the top 
    10 publishers depending on the genre selected. To get the top publisher you
    only need to view the top-most bar.
    </p>
    <p>
    Question 2: It was simple to create drawings without having to worry about
    rendering each individual shape in html ourselves. It was useful to group data 
    together in a "modular" approach to simplify the logic behind what each bar/pie
    slice stores as data. Lastly, it is easily usable with interactive elements in
    html to change the graphs upon input.
    </p>
    <p>
    Question 3: As a trade off to being easy to use, it is limited to the specific
    types of things precoded into the library so it is not as customizable, as in
    if you had a much more complicated dataset to represent, it might be difficult 
    realize your ideas and you may need to compromise. One general con is that the
    documentation is not very clear which makes it somewhat difficult to use more 
    obscure functionalities. A last disadvantage is that while d3 does a good job 
    grouping objects, it can be tricky to keep them organized and to make sure you 
    are calling on the correct parent object and/or selecting the right html item
    to call functions on. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Question 4: In response to "Accesible Data Visualization", I think the graphs
    are quickly understandable. Being ordered particularly in the bar charts from
    lowest to highest lets the reader quickly determine what the best producer for
    a genre is, or what the best selling video game of all time was, without having
    to try and guess which bar is longer than the others. One issue I ran into
    in regards to color pallets was picking a suitable one. I ended up deciding to 
    have single colors for the bar chart and only different colors for the pie chart. This way
    there was no misleading information in the bar charts about the color indicating
    something it doesnt. The length of the bar tells all. The pie chart was necessary 
    to add some color in order to differentiate the different slices, but again I
    made sure to keep some seperators that were white so colorblind people could
    discern the different segments as well.
    </p>
    <p>
    Question 5: Before I began coding, I planned out what each graph would be, and 
    made sure they answered the questions appropriately. One thing I struggled with 
    non-colorwise as mentioned in the last paragraph was text and particularly labels
    of longer titles. This was quite difficult to choose and I think the biggest factor
    in there being a conflict was the dataset itself. It is quite difficult to abreviate
    some of these game titles into acronyms or even shorten them all properly since
    acronyms don't always make sense, and some games have important information at their
    ends such as "2" or "Wii" that differentiate them from other nearly identical ones.
    Had I more time I would hard code in the y axis labels for the static bar plot in 
    graph 1, however when trying to make substrings for them it seemed to offset the 
    bars since the y axis labels were defined within a mapping used in the y axis.
    The tool tip was supposed to be used to reveal the full title which it does,
    however these issues stopped me from shortening them.
